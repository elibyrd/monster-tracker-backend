# Monster Tracker Backend

Lightweight backend designed to provide persistent monster data for the [Monster Tracker](https://github.com/elibyrd/monster-tracker) webapp.

## Local setup
This application was developed with [Laravel Sail](https://laravel.com/docs/10.x/sail). After starting the Docker container, navigate to the code repo (if on Windows, open the Linux environment console) and `npm run dev` to serve the React content.
